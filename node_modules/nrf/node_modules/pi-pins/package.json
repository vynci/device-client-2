  "readme": "# pi-pins\n\nControl, read, and monitor Linux GPIO devices from node.js.\n\nA little set of interrupt-supporting wrappers around `\"/sys/class/gpio\"` interface, to control pins on e.g. the Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone, as originally written to help get [node-nrf](https://github.com/natevw/node-nrf) off the ground.\n\nIt's synchronous/blocking because I forget why (probably to match Tessel?)\n\n## Example usage\n\nFirst add a jumper wire from GPIO pin 17 to GPIO pin 22, and `npm install pi-pins`. Then:\n\n    var pin1 = require(\"pi-pins\").connect(17),\n        pin2 = require(\"pi-pins\").connect(22);\n    pin2.mode('in');\n    pin1.mode('high'); console.log(\"Should be true:\", pin2.value());\n    pin1.mode('low'); console.log(\"Should be false:\", pin2.value());\n    pin2.on('rise', function () {       // …or `'fall'`, or `'both'`\n        console.log(\"RING A DING A LING\");\n    });\n    pin2.value(true);\n\n\n## API\n\nHere are its methods:\n\n* `var GPIO = require('pi-pins');` — import suggestion, used below\n* `var pin = GPIO.connect(number)` — get pin ready for use. Could very possibly fail if you don't use `sudo` to run your script or set perms or whatever. but then, the software and hardware, working together, as one, until the very end\n* `pin.mode(direction)` — set pin direction to `'in'` or `'out'` (or go straight to `'low'` or `'high'` output)\n* `pin.value()` — read the pin's value (`'in'` mode)\n* `pin.value(boolean)` — set the pin's value (`'out'` mode)\n\n\nIt also does [events](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html) (parties, weddings):\n\n* `'rise'` — emitted when `gpio.value()` goes from `false` to `true`\n* `'fall'` — emitted when `gpio.value()` goes from `true` to `false`\n* `'both'` — emitted whenever `gpio.value()` changes\n\nIf a tree might fall/rise/both in the forest and nobody is watching, neither is `pi-pins`.\n\n\n## Licentious\n\nI sure hope not.
